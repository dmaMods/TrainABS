This mod separates the railway into blocks which are then protected by traffic lights.

In order for the mod to work, it is necessary to add traffic lights to at least one junction.

After that, the mod scans the rail network and calculates the blocks.

A block is a part of a track between:
- two junctions (no matter they have or have not traffic lights)
- junction and train station
- any junction and/or node protected by traffic lights

Important: this mod doesn't change the physical appearance of the railroad, so to see traffic lights, you need a railroad that has them built in! You can use one of these railways:
- Vanilla track with DB signals:

- Croatian railways track with HÅ½ catenary and signals:

USAGE:
Activate node selection with mod shortcut (default: Ctrl-Shift-N; you can change this in options).
As you can see on picture attached above, green circle mean that you can add traffic lights to selected junction by left click. To remove traffic lights, use left click again (circle above node is red if node have lights).
To add traffic lights on straight part of railway use Shift key + left click (selection will become yellow circle).

After each change (adding and/or deleting nodes), the mod will recalculate the blocks by itself, but the possibility of forced recalculation of the blocks still exists. You can force update network with (default) Ctrl-Shift-U.

If you change the entire railway network from one type of rails to another (using RON or another mod), we advise you to save and reload the game and then add traffic lights.

Where to set traffic lights: in all junctions with three or more segments and also on long straight parts. Recommended distance between two straight nodes is 40-50 units for high traffic railway or 70-80 units on low traffic railway. If you're using long trains do not set blocks too short.

Also, it's not necessary, but it would be good practice to place traffic lights at ALL end nodes where your rail network connects to the outside world (see picture above). The exit light to the outside world is always green while the entry signal is controlled by TrainABS mod.

DO NOT set traffic lights on station transition node. It will block whole station! This is because whole train station is single segment and game engine set traffic lights to both side of the segment.

Mod also have additional two shortcuts: to set all nodes to red or green.

Warning: setting the green light on all nodes disables the mod's block function, so this is not recommended except in cases of traffic jam. If you use the green light function, we recommend that you use the red light function immediately after the jam has passed to activate the block function of the mod.

The red light function is only temporary (it does not permanently block all traffic lights). This function, in addition to setting all traffic lights to red, also resets the assigned green light rights for all trains, which is good if the game deletes a train that already had the assigned green light.

Compatibility: TrainABS mod is compatible with Traffic Manager President Edition so you can use both at the same time. Note: TrainABS takes control over the rail network, so some functions that TM:PE has that are related to the rail network may not work.

This mod is still in development and there will be improvements, so all suggestions and comments are welcome.
